## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation  
Get started in seconds. All you need is Python 3.8+.

```bash
pip install devkit-cli
````

### 2. Configure Your AI *(Optional, but Recommended)*

To unlock the AI features, you need a free Google AI API key.

* Get your key from **Google AI Studio**.

Set it up with DevKit:

```bash
devkit config --api-key YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

### 3. Basic Usage

Here's a quick tour of what you can do:

```bash
# Get a command for finding large files
devkit ask "find all files over 500MB in my home directory"

# Save a useful command as a snippet
devkit snippet save large-files "find ~ -type f -size +500M" --tags "disk,files"

# Run your new snippet anytime
devkit snippet run large-files

# Stage your files and let AI write the commit message
git add .
devkit commit --ai

# Something broke? See what you did last and get an AI analysis.
devkit rewind --analyze
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Installation

The recommended way to install DevKit is via pip:

```bash
pip install devkit-cli
```

This will make the `devkit` command available in your terminal.

---

### AI Commands

#### `ask` - Get Command Suggestions

Never google a command again. Describe what you want to do, and DevKit will give you the command.

```bash
devkit ask "how to check disk usage by directory"
devkit ask "compress all jpg images in the current folder"
```

#### `explain` - Understand a Command

Unsure what a cryptic command does? Get a clear, part-by-part explanation.

```bash
devkit explain "find . -name '*.py' -exec grep -l 'import' {} \;"
devkit explain "git rebase -i HEAD~3"
```

---

### Snippet Management

#### `snippet save`

Save any command for later use. Adding tags helps you find it easily.

```bash
devkit snippet save git-undo "git reset --soft HEAD~1" --tags "git,undo"
devkit snippet save k8s-pods "kubectl get pods -n production" --tags "k8s,prod"
```

#### `snippet list` & `snippet search`

View all your snippets or find specific ones.

```bash
# List everything
devkit snippet list

# Filter by tag
devkit snippet list --tag git

# Search by name, command, or tag
devkit snippet search "git"
```

#### `snippet run`

Execute a saved snippet directly.

```bash
devkit snippet run git-undo
```

---

### Git Commit Helper

#### `commit`

Create perfectly formatted conventional commit messages.

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Let AI generate the commit message from your staged changes
devkit commit --ai

# Or use the interactive helper
devkit commit
```

---

### Time-Travel & Rollback

#### `rewind`

View your command history and get AI analysis to debug issues.

```bash
# See the last 10 commands you ran
devkit rewind

# Get an AI analysis of what might have gone wrong recently
devkit rewind --analyze

# Show only commands that failed
devkit rewind --failures
```

#### `panic`

Made a mistake in production? Panic mode scans for recent dangerous commands (like deploy, delete, push --force) and suggests how to roll them back.

```bash
# Something just broke after a command? Run this immediately!
devkit panic
```
